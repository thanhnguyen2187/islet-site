After finished "How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big", I kind of
liked the author, and searched for others book by him. "Win Bigly" certainly did
not disappoint me. If I have to summarize the book, I will vaguely borrow the
author's words: "'How to Fail' is about persuading yourself; 'Win Bigly' is
about persuading the others". I can recall that analogy is not an effective way
of persuasion, but I am not trying to tell you to read the book anyway.

"Win Bigly" is split into five parts. The topics then follow a simple structure
on irrational mind of human beings, recognize it, and use it. The author
mentions Trump a lot on the man's business skills, and did well convincing me
on that. I am not too well-versed in America's politics, so I will refrain on
commenting the correctness of the topic, however.

An important theme of the book is on human's irrational mind, how we "make our
decisions first, and rationalize it later". We then are not as rational as we
make out to be. There is a million "small" tweaks that are used to persuade us
on life. Physical attractiveness and wording are the two most brought up in the
book.

There is another subject that is frequently referred at, however. It was
"filters", or in my own word, "lenses". I am strongly resonated with the
author's view: people are not right nor wrong with their own "filters"/"lenses"
on the world. Understanding that helps a lot with our ability to attune, and
sympathize.

In the end, I still have the same conclusion as [another review on another book
of the author](./book-review-how-to-fail-at-almost-everything-and-still-win-big.md)

> I highly recommend the book to anyone, as long as they are open enough for
> some "small" profanities [...].

(a profanity here is his praise of President Trump, which does not matter to an
average Vietnamese dude like me, but bothers lots of Americans)
