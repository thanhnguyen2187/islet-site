SICP stands for ["Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs"](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html), also known as
["The Wizard Book"](https://wiki.c2.com/?TheWizardBook) is a book known for its
challenging subjects, exercises, and rather "weird" writing style. I finished
the first chapter, and working on the second chapter. The "LISP enlightenment"
that people jokes about has not came upon me yet, but I found my thoughts on
programming better already.

Here are some interesting excerpts from
the book:

> [...] computer language is not just a way of getting a computer to perform
> operations but rather that it is a novel formal medium for expressing ideas
> about methodology.

> [...] programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for
> machines to execute.

> The general technique of isolating the parts of a program that deal with how
> data objects are represented from the parts of a program that deal with how
> data objects are used is a powerful design methodology called _data
> abstraction_.

> The basic idea of abstraction is to structure the programs that are to use
> compound data objects so that they operate on "abstract data." [...], our
> program should use data in such a way to as to make no assumption about the
> data that are not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand.

The way you "suppose" to read the book is not usual, either. From my experience,
trying to skim the text and understand it leaves you a shallow confusion at
best. I am not a fan of the writing style, but do read them carefully, and try
your best implementing every exercises throughout. Only look at a solution on
the internet after you did spend your time and get stuck. Also, do not be worry
that LISP seems "dead". While parentheses looks confusing at first, you
naturally get it after a while.

Good luck to you (and to my future self) on being a
[SICPers](https://www.sicpers.info/) (mind you, the website do exists).
