The name is "Th√†nh" (but often be diacritics-stripped to "Thanh" for easier
typing). I was born in 1997 in case you are a Vietnamese who wants to find a
proper pronoun.

I worked mostly as a Software Engineer in the backend spectrum. You are expected
to find my rambles about frontend frameworks, or Vim, or topics outside of
coding and software engineering here, however. You can see every category
[here](/categories/), and all the tags [there](/tags/).

Please look at my [resume](/resume.pdf) or
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nguyen-huy-thanh/) if you need
work-related informations.
