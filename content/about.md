The name is Thanh. My work was mostly in the backend developing spectrum, but my
experiences are not only in there. You are expected to find my rambles about
frontend frameworks, or Vim, or topics outside of coding and software
engineering here.

My posts are categorized vaguely following
[Divio's Documentation System](https://documentation.divio.com/):

- [explanation](/categories/explanation/): high level view of stuff
- [tutorial](/categories/tutorial/): step-by-step on how to do something for
  newbies
- [how-to guide](/categories/how-to-guide/): a guide for people who is familiar
  with the topic
- [reference](/categories/reference/): code/configuration line-by-line
  explanation

You can see every category [here](/categories/), and all the tags
[there](/tags/). My resume can be found
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BXOK8eJourY_zE4nNqdfMdyaW9Nu5AVB/view),
if you think there is an interesting role for me.
