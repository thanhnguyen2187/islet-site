I am a young dude (at the writing time; 24-year and 3-ish-month old to be
precise), but I sometimes thought about the topic however. If I were to die
right after writing this, I hope that there are a few things that the living
people can help me with.

## Body Donation

The brain and the memories are dead, but if other parts can live on and be
useful, let them do it. I am an aphantasiac (one who has aphantasia), and is not
too afraid of thinking about my body being "messed up" by people. I can relate
to the fear people have, however.

## Natural Burial

I actually had to research a bit on finding the right word, and "natural burial"
seems to fit my idea well. Cremation (disposing dead body through burning) needs
more energy. "Traditional" burial needs a coffin, and it takes more time for my
body to fully disappear. Hence I choose "natural" burial, which means letting my
remains disintegrate hassle free.

## "Online" Legacies

My website is hosted a cheap VPN, with a "complex" build process. I am planning
to simplify process, but my hope is:

- Having the website up as it is; I have a bit of money within my VISA card that
  the VPN provider can charge for a few decades.
- Having my GitHub repository up as it is.

## "Offline" Legacies

I do not have a lot in my possession, but my wish is that my family members
(parents and older sister) can find something useful and take it with them. The
objects are:

- PC (with monitors, and a keyboard, and a mouse)
- Kindle
- Musical instrumentals (guitar, ukulele, and kalimba)
- Clothes

The stuff that "does not spark joy" (left-over, I mean) can be donated, or be
thrown away, or be disposed, or being done anything by my family members. At
last, please give the letters from my ex-girlfriend back to her and tell her I
really appreciate them.

## Conclusion

This is a short and vague post, but the topic is really heavy. Thank you for
sticking through!
