I encountered the topic over the years, but did not take my time deep diving
into it. SICP mentioned it again, and I was like: "Okay. It must be now."

In the post, I will try to "build" the stuff up, from simple to complex, with
some sample code in Lisp. Please forgive me if the code looks ugly, since I was
not too familiar with the syntax, nor the good practices of the language.
