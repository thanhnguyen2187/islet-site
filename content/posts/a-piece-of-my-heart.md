To my dear, who received "A Piece of My Heart" in Vietnamese,

I wrote you a letter with the same name, did I not? I still felt the urge to
write you another, however. The letter would never be published however. I was
too shy for that.

As days went by, my heart still ached every time my mind is free. I arbitrarily
thought about you, and our memories, and our stories. I missed you a lot. I
missed your smile. I missed your voice. I missed the way you cared about me. I
missed the warmth that you had. I missed the colour that you brought. Without
you, the world was so cold. Without you, everything became more dull and
tasteless. Without you, I could hardly find my purposes. Without you, I became
broken.

I was filled with sorrow that we needed to part. I had a hard time understanding
myself, and could only give you a vague answer about my future worrying. At the
time, I finally realized that it was our different in thoughts. Was I afraid
that we would not happy together, or... I would not be happy with you?

Even what was the question, and what was the answer, you did not deserve someone
with a question and worrying like that. You deserved better. You deserved
happiness.

English does not have the word, or maybe, I did not have the vocabulary. The
word is "thương", and the sentence is: "Thương em nhiều lắm."

From the bottom of my heart, I wish you well.
